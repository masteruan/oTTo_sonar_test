# oTTo_sonar_test
oTTo DIY is a great project that use a 3D pronted robot to teach coding to the kids. You can see all the information about oTTo to the oTTo official page: https://www.ottodiy.com

With this code you can test the sonar sensor.
Upload the code on your Arduino nano inside the oTTo robot. After that open the Serial Monitor and see the measure of the distance.

N.B.
That code works without oTTo library
